The players need to communicate and cooperate to keep\r\n        the engine running, while also steering away from obstacles. The game is\r\n        released on Itch.io, and can be downloaded and played{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://bjorne-oma.itch.io/crank-the-coal-bob\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n          here\r\n        </a>\r\n        .\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={img3} alt=\"\" />\r\n      <h2>The Idea</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I solo developed this project in a week in the beginning of January 2021\r\n        using Unity with C# and Blender. The project had two main purposes:\r\n        Practicing low poly 3d-art(as I had just started learning Blender), and\r\n        completing a project in a limited amount of time.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        I gave myself one week to complete the game, and started right away by\r\n        brainstorming ideas. After splatting enough ink on my virtual\r\n        whiteboard, the idea came to me. I wanted to replicate the game-feel of\r\n        one of my favorite games, Overcooked. Overcooked is a multiplayer\r\n        local-coop game about running a restaurant with all kinds of impractical\r\n        kitchens. It is heavily reliant on cooperation, and it is also chaotic\r\n        and a ton of fun.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I don't know how the idea of creating a coal-fueled castle came to me,\r\n        but when it did I went with it, as the clock was ticking. I quickly\r\n        sketched out the whole game, and spent some time listing most of the\r\n        tasks that needed to be done.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Getting Organized</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        To organize all these tasks, and to make sure I was always on track to\r\n        finish the game in time, I used Trello. I divided all the tasks by type,\r\n        i.e. coding, modeling, animation, and set a date for each of the\r\n        categories to be finished. This ended up working great, and in the end\r\n        the (very close to) empty trello board was a beatiful sight.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={trello} alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n      <h2>Art</h2>\r\n      <div className=\"dirRow\">\r\n        <p>\r\n          For the art I went for a simplistic low-poly 3d-look. This style has\r\n          two big advantages over a lot of other styles. Its low poly count\r\n          makes it very performant, which means I don't need to spend a lot of\r\n          time optimizing. It is also very quick and easy to make, which is\r\n          cruicial for a project with such a small time budget.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src={catapult} alt=\"\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        I modeled everything in Blender, a powerful and free 3d software. I\r\n        reused as much as possible, for example by only making one human and\r\n        using it for both the players and all the NPCs(non-player characters) in\r\n        the game. Some of the models were static, for example the trees and\r\n        rocks, while others needed to be animated. To do this I rigged them,\r\n        meaning I created a bone structure for them. This made it so I could\r\n        just rotate a few bones instead of moving hundreds of vertices when\r\n        animating.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div className=\"dirRow\">\r\n        <video src={anim1} controls></video>\r\n        <video src={anim3} controls></video>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h2>Logic</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The code for this game was quite simple to make, as there were no\r\n        complex systems like enemy AI or loading and unloading objects\r\n        dynamically. The main challenge was coding as quickly as possible while\r\n        still making the code solid enough to not cause lots of bugs and issues.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The most interesting part of the logic, was the interactable system.\r\n        There are six different objects the players interact with in the game:\r\n        the coal tray, the torch holder, the coal furnace, the steering lever,\r\n        the trumpeteer and the catapult. Some of these work in the same way,\r\n        like the coal tray and the torch holder, which both just delete you\r\n        current item and give you a coal or a torch. The furnace only deletes\r\n        your item, and only if it is coal and if it has room for it. The\r\n        catapult even has two different states that require two different items.\r\n        I solved this by making one interactable class that held some key\r\n        variables that most of or all of the interactable objects cared about. I\r\n        then created subclasses for the more specific ones like the lever and\r\n        the furnace.\r\n      </p>\r\n      {/*Video med close-up av interaksjon med ulike interactables */}\r\n      <h2>SFX and VFX</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Even though I only had one week to complete the game, I wanted it to\r\n        feel good to play. I therefore spent quite a bit of time finding sound\r\n        effects and mixing them together. I found the sound effects on\r\n        Zapsplat.com, which had everything I need from enginge noise to trees\r\n        falling and people shouting. I processed the audio in Audacity, and I\r\n        think it turned out great!\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The VFX in the game were all very simple. All the particle systems in\r\n        the game use cubes. For the smoke, I made black transparent cubes that\r\n        grow over time. The fire particles have an emissive material(they give\r\n        off light) and shrink over time. The results were more than acceptable.\r\n        With the sound and VFX in place, burning down a forest suddenly felt\r\n        pretty great.\r\n      </p>\r\n      {/*Video av skog som brenner */}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default CrankTheCoal;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Jolaspelet2019.b2a8619f.mp4\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Jolaspelet2020Gameplay.facee11b.mp4\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/JolaspeletAction.ecbf81f4.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/JolaspeletHighScore.ef5ddd40.png\";","import { Link } from \"react-scroll\";\r\nimport { useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nimport jolaspelet2019 from \"../../assets/videos/Jolaspelet2019.mp4\";\r\nimport jolaspeletVideo from \"../../assets/videos/Jolaspelet2020Gameplay.mp4\";\r\nimport imgAction from \"../../assets/images/JolaspeletAction.png\";\r\nimport imgHighScore from \"../../assets/images/JolaspeletHighScore.png\";\r\n\r\nconst Jolaspelet = () => {\r\n  const history = useHistory();\r\n\r\n  function routeToHome() {\r\n    history.push(\"/\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"project\">\r\n      <div className=\"projectHeader\">\r\n        <Link\r\n          to=\"projectPlacement\"\r\n          spy={true}\r\n          smooth={true}\r\n          duration={500}\r\n          onClick={routeToHome}\r\n        >\r\n          <i className=\"arrow\"></i>\r\n        </Link>\r\n\r\n        <h1 className=\"projectTitle\">Jolaspelet 2020</h1>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Jolaspelet 2020 (translates to \"The Christmas Game\") is a game I made\r\n        for me and my wife's families to compete in during the christmas\r\n        holiday. I made a very rudimentary game for christmas 2019 that became a\r\n        hit, so I wanted to make this battle of the clans into a christmas\r\n        tradition.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={imgAction} alt=\"\" />\r\n      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I had two clear goals in mind when designing this game. Firstly I wanted\r\n        the game to be accessible to everyone in the family. This meant that\r\n        control schemes like moving with WASD, while also doing something with\r\n        the right hand were out of the question. The game also needed to be\r\n        intuitive and easily approachable. Secondly I wanted the game to be\r\n        competetive. I wanted the players to be able to measure their success\r\n        and compare it to others.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Last years game set the standard for these philosophies by accident.\r\n        Even though it was strikingly simple, it was a hit!\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video src={jolaspelet2019} controls></video>\r\n      <h2>The Game</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The game I ended up creating was a typing game. You play as santa claus\r\n        who is riding in his sleigh, when suddenly rockets start flying towards\r\n        you! Luckily you have your canon ready, and the rockets have a weak\r\n        spot, a certain letter. Click the letter, shoot down the rocket, and\r\n        repeat until... Well until your sleigh falls down.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video src={jolaspeletVideo} controls></video>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Typing is something everyone in the family is familiar with, and also\r\n        something that is useful to practice, so I thought it was the perfect\r\n        fit for the input of the game.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>High Score</h2>\r\n      <div className=\"dirRow\">\r\n        <p>\r\n          In 2019 the high score system was made up of rumors going around the\r\n          block, and while that had it's own charm I wanted to go bigger in\r\n          2020. I ended up creating a high score board that could be accessed in\r\n          the game and at{\" \"}\r\n          <a href=\"https://jolaspelet.no\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n            jolaspelet.no\r\n          </a>\r\n          . This ended up working great, and checking the website for any new\r\n          records became an exciting part of the holiday.

Let me show you how it works!\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={turnBased} alt=\"\" />\r\n      <h2>The Game</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The game is turn based, and each turn the player can move one of it's\r\n        green \"hero\" boxes up to three tiles. After the player has moved, the\r\n        blue and red \"enemy\" boxes move one tile in the direction that their\r\n        arrow indicates. If there is a green box in the way of an enemy moving,\r\n        it will instead turn to face the other colors side. If two enemies move\r\n        into the same square on the same turn, they both dissapear. The players\r\n        goal is to get all of the enemies to their colors side.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video src={level1} controls></video>\r\n      <h2>The Data Structure</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The heart of the data structure is the Tile Manager, which holds the two\r\n        dimensional array of tiles that represent the board. It also has methods\r\n        for changing the colors of the tiles based on who's turn it is, and also\r\n        which hero the player has chosen(if any).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Another key piece of the puzzle is the Unit Manager. It holds a List of\r\n        all the Units in the current level. Each unit holds an (int, int)-tuple\r\n        which represents it's position on the board, and is a member of one of\r\n        the subclasses Enemy or Hero. The Enemy class holds a color(blue or red)\r\n        and the direction they are going in. Each turn, the Unit Manager tells\r\n        the Tile Manager which state the game is in, and feeds it which Hero has\r\n        been chosen. The Tile Manager then updates the colors of the tiles to\r\n        show the player which tiles can be clicked.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div className=\"dirRow\">\r\n        <p>\r\n          The layout of each level is stored in a scriptable object class named\r\n          LevelLayout. Scriptable objects in Unity are scripts that can be\r\n          instantiated on files in the project instead of on objects in the\r\n          scene. Each Level Layout holds an array of all the hero starting\r\n          positions and all the enemy starting positions in the level. The enemy\r\n          starting positions also contain which color the enemy is, and which\r\n          direction it starts in. With this system I can create new Level Layout\r\n          files and set the position of all the units, as shown in the picture.\r\n          While this solution technically works, it is incredibly tedious, since\r\n          you have to count out where each piece is on the x- and y-axes.\r\n          Luckily I had an idea on how to simplify this process.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src={turnBasedLevelLayout} alt=\"\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <h2>The Level Editor</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The level editor lets me click tiles and use keys on the keyboard to\r\n        change it. The operations include creating a hero, creating an enemy,\r\n        deleting a unit, changing the color of an enemy, and changing an enemies\r\n        starting rotation. This tool makes creating and levels a lot faster, and\r\n        infinitely more intuitive.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video src={levelEditor} controls></video>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TheTower;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Climate01.2258a5da.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Climate02.133f204a.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Climate03.caa934f7.png\";","import { Link } from \"react-scroll\";\r\nimport { useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nimport image01 from \"../../assets/images/Climate01.png\";\r\nimport image02 from \"../../assets/images/Climate02.png\";\r\nimport image03 from \"../../assets/images/Climate03.png\";\r\n\r\nconst ClimateCalculator = () => {\r\n  const history = useHistory();\r\n\r\n  function routeToHome() {\r\n    history.push(\"/\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"project\">\r\n      <div className=\"projectHeader\">\r\n        <Link\r\n          to=\"projectPlacement\"\r\n          spy={true}\r\n          smooth={true}\r\n          duration={500}\r\n          onClick={routeToHome}\r\n        >\r\n          <i className=\"arrow\"></i>\r\n        </Link>\r\n\r\n        <h1 className=\"projectTitle\">Climate Calculator</h1>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        This is a prototype made for NRK in a school project.

Collaborating on a long-term\r\n        project taught me a lot about communication. I found I needed to explain\r\n        what I was doing to Lykke, who did not have the same proficiency in the\r\n        techincal parts of making games as me. This didn't go smoothly from the\r\n        start, but after a while I started to get an understanding of what was\r\n        understandable and not, which helped a lot.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>Building a Community</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        When launching an indie game it's important to find early adopters to\r\n        get the game's hype and sale going. To do this we created a discord\r\n        server where we posted development blogs about the game and our\r\n        progress. Through posting concept art and gifs on a few reddit sites and\r\n        on other game development related discord servers, our server grew to\r\n        150 people. The development blogs were the main piece of content on the\r\n        server. Me and Lykke alternated on writing these and posted one evey\r\n        week. These became natural talking points to start the conversation and\r\n        discussion about the game. The community that we built turned out to be\r\n        a great source of feedback for everything from concept art to game\r\n        design considerations.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={theBog1} alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"imageText\">Concept art by Lykke Lilleb√∏e</div>\r\n      <h2>Staying Motivated</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Staying motivated during this long project without any external\r\n        motivation was a big challenge for me. The times it was fun and exciting\r\n        were easy enough, but when really being stuck in a coding problem, or\r\n        having doubts about whether the game would be any fun at all, I needed\r\n        tools to stay motivated to work every day. One of these tools became\r\n        essential for me.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={theBog2} alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"imageText\">Concept art by Lykke Lilleb√∏e</div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I learned how to set good goals. To set a good goal, I needed to set a\r\n        goal where I had full control of the outcome. I could a list of tasks as\r\n        my goal for the day, but knowing how long they would take and what\r\n        problems would arise is an impossible task. My goal every day therefore\r\n        became to work efficiently a certain amount of hours. This made it so\r\n        that even on the days that I only wrote code that ended up not working,\r\n        I was still happy as long as I had worked my best. Since most of the\r\n        techical challenges in making the game were new to me, I spent a lot of\r\n        time not solving the problem in an efficient way, but rather learning\r\n        how to tackle it by heading straight at them and most of the time doing\r\n        them completely wrong. If I considered the days I didn't create good\r\n        solutions as bad days, I would have a really hard time staying\r\n        motivated.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TheBog;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/avatarImage.4317f6b6.jpg\";","import avatar from \"../assets/images/avatarImage.jpg\";\r\n\r\nconst About = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div id=\"about\">\r\n      <div id=\"aboutBorder\" />\r\n      <div>\r\n        <div className=\"aboutText\">\r\n          <img alt=\"Bilde\" src={avatar} className=\"avatar\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            bjorneoma@gmail.com <br />\r\n            957 84 182 <br />\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj√∏rne-oma/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n              LinkedIn\r\n            </a>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"aboutSkills\">\r\n          <div className=\"skills\">\r\n            <h2 className=\"skillTitle\">CONFIDENT WITH</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"skillsText\">C#, Google Design Sprint, Figma, Unity</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"skills\">\r\n            <h2 className=\"skillTitle\">COMFORTABLE WITH</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"skillsText\">\r\n              Python, Git, Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Adobe XD, Blender\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","import NavBar from \"./components/navBar\";\nimport \"./assets/styles.css\";\nimport { HashRouter as Router, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Home from \"./components/home\";\nimport Projects from \"./components/projects\";\nimport crankTheCoal from \"./components/projects/crankTheCoal\";\nimport jolaspelet from \"./components/projects/jolaspelet\";\nimport Tower from \"./components/projects/theTower\";\nimport ClimateCalculator from \"./components/projects/climateCalculator\";\nimport TheBog from \"./components/projects/theBog\";\nimport About from \"./components/about\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router basename=\"/\">\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <Home />\n        <NavBar />\n        <div id=\"projectPlacement\" />\n        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Projects} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/crankTheCoal\" component={crankTheCoal} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/jolaspelet\" component={jolaspelet} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/theTower\" component={Tower} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/climateCalculator\" component={ClimateCalculator} />\n        <Route exact path=\"/theBog\" component={TheBog} />\n        <About />\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
