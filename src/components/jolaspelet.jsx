        Jolaspelet 2020 (translates to "The Christmas Game") is a game I made
        with my brother as a competetive game for me and my wife's families to
        play during the christmas holiday. I made a very rudimentary game for
        christmas 2019 that became a hit, so I wanted to make this battle of the
        clans into a christmas tradition.
